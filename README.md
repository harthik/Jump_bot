The robot uses a over locking mechanism in the form of a 4-bar chain to achive the desired actuation of the legs. Due to the limited power of the servo motors the robot is not able to properly jump off the ground but is capable of lifting off the ground for a very brief period and jumps about 2 mm off thr ground before landing.

More work into optimizing the length of links to achive the desired accleration is being done currently.
